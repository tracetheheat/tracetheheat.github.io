Below, you could se a policy paper I was preparing for [Urban Policy Observatory](http://obserwatorium.miasta.pl/) on COVID-19 and current (non)mobility patterns.

It's part of my ongoing research on this topic, which covers mainly the first month and a half of the current pandemic and lockdown.

So see you soon with another policy paper!
