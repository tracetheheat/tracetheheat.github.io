> When it clicks! From personal page to project blog editor. That is the cause why I've been "silent" for a while

You might have noticed that this blog is not really a place with rush traffic this year. Have I lost my motivation? Is blogging no longer a priority for me?

## Not really!

The idea to create this page with a blog was to have a hub to promote all my activities. It should also be a space to randomly reflect on what I'm doing. It is easier to send a link or a QR code than redirect people to LinkedIn, Twitter, ResearchGate or any other profile that is just trending. 

## So what has happened?

Shortly, the long-term plan with this page just clicked. This means that it has opened me to the possibility of being responsible for scientific communication in one of our university projects, the [HES-GEO](https://hesgeo.blog/).

Sure, in the beginning, I was not aiming for some very project. The general goal was to be seen while developing other academic-related skills that might be useful at the department I'm studying.

The HES-GEO project is not only focusing on the research as such but also on establishing a unit supporting research capacity. The project blog should thus cover not only the project logs but a whole array of other topics linked to academia. 

## Visits, Milestones, Writing

Outlining the content strategy for the project blog is a challenge and a valuable lesson. A different issue is preparing guidelines for other contributors to keep consistency and designing the content to avoid heavy blocks of texts. Quite a lot for one, but I'm working my way to deliver good content. Hopefully, this blog will benefit from the lesson learned too.

Since I jumped into the project, we have managed to report not only about the project log like various visits and trainings but also touched on critical academic topics.

## See yourself!

I recommend you check out the posts focusing on [academic popularization](https://hesgeo.blog/category/popularization/). Namely, the [interview with Agnieszka Defus](https://hesgeo.blog/2022/01/26/not-only-for-insiders-popularization-and-academia/) or the [scicom experiences of our project partners](https://hesgeo.blog/2022/06/03/story-of-eureka-the-importance-of-scientific-communication/). 

Besides, you shouldn't miss the entries covering [academic writing](https://hesgeo.blog/2022/06/23/publish-or-perish-training-in-leuven/) or the [challenges of grant proposals](https://hesgeo.blog/2022/04/27/grant-writing-experiences/). Possibly the most complicated tasks on the researcher's agenda. 

## Never miss a postâ€¦

And add the [hesgeo.blog](https://hesgeo.blog/) on your watch list. There is gonna be a lot more!
