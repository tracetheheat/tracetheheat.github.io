One of my last posts here are dedicated to the new issues raised by the growing popularity of micro-mobility shared schemes. Besides the reflections of the critical problems, I'm also pointing out what should be the essential solution to most of them: the cooperation between the private and public sectors.

Currently, a new body called [Micro-mobility For Europe (MMfE)](https://micromobilityforeurope.eu/e-scooter-operators-launch-new-eu-association/) has just formed. As stated in the first and only post published so far, the coalition aims to ***"create one voice for providers of shared micro-mobility solutions to transform urban mobility in Europe."***

> Micro-mobility for Europe currently represents: Bird, Bolt, Dott, Free Now, Lime, Tier, Voi., Wind

The press release is also not forgetting to mention the role of the shared micro-mobility solutions in the current shift into a more sustainable urban and transport system. As said by Catriona Meehan, Co-Chair of the coalition and representative of Wind: "***the micro-mobility has revolutionised urban mobility and established itself as an essential alternative to personal car ownership and use***."

All of this is obviously true. Sadly, the glimpse of the current problems making some cities abolish the shared-micro-mobility services is present only between the lines. Especially realising that without effectively addressing the operational issues of shared micro-mobility solutions firstly, we could hardly talk about supporting sustainable mobility.

What connects the founding member of the coalition is the need to make the micro-mobility solutions genuinely sustainable. This should be done by providing the needed data for the public authorities to understand how effectively integrate the micro-mobility solutions into the current urban eco-system. Besides that, the coalition already defined the top priorities ***like urban mobility, data governance and circular economy to ensure that shared micro-mobility is an integral part of EU policy developments in the coming years.***

The aim of the coalition thus does not differ from the purpose presented by various shared micro-mobility providers. The smart and green discourse seems to be the ongoing mantra that might be easy to sell but hard to sustain or even reach.

I'm glad there is a unifying body trying to represent the whole shared micro-mobility segment. However, more important, it is to finally take a break from copywriting and marketing strategies and zoom into single municipalities and neighbourhoods, open dialogue between various stakeholders, start bringing up solutions, and share the good examples of shared micro-mobility managerial practises.

Let's wait for the new development of the micro-mobility segment once the snow will melt and the e-scooters will pop-up in the public space. Indeed I'm not the only one ready to observe how the story of MMfE and the shared micro-mobility segment will develop.
