> In newly published paper I've been writing with Dr Daniel Baldwin [Hess](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1_FINjQAAAAJ&hl=cs), we investigated 146 studies on fare-free public transport across 300+ cities. What shocked us? Only 25% of research actually examines how these programs affect vulnerable populations.

# Making Public Transit Free AND Fair: Lessons from Global Research

Imagine a world where anyone can hop on a bus or train without worrying about the fare. That's the promise of fare-free public transport (FFPT) – and it's already happening in over 300 cities worldwide. But new research reveals a troubling gap: while these programs aim to help everyone, they often overlook the people who need them most.

## The Hidden Inequality in "Free for All"

A comprehensive review of 146 studies on FFPT programs found that only 25% actually considered how these initiatives affect vulnerable populations – including low-income communities, women, LGBTQ+ individuals, racial minorities, and non-native language speakers. This oversight matters because transportation isn't just about getting from A to B. It's about accessing jobs, education, healthcare, and community.

## Real-World Successes (and Failures)

Some cities are getting it right. In India, four states now offer fare-free public transport specifically for women and transgender individuals, successfully increasing women's workforce participation. Estonia's capital, Tallinn, runs one of the world's largest FFPT programs, which has particularly benefited Russian-speaking minorities and elderly residents.

But challenges persist. In India, some bus drivers refuse to stop for women passengers, despite the free-fare policy. In Brisbane, Australia, research revealed shocking discrimination: white passengers were twice as likely as Black passengers to receive free rides when unable to pay.

## Building Better Free Transport

For policymakers and transport advocates, success requires going beyond simply eliminating fares. Start by collecting and actually using demographic data – track how different groups use your services and whether they're truly benefiting. Think intersectionally, recognizing that people often face multiple barriers. A low-income elderly woman who speaks limited English faces different challenges than each factor alone would suggest. While FFPT should be universal, actively monitor whether vulnerable groups are accessing services and ensure routes connect affordable housing to essential services and job centers.

Community members also play a crucial role in creating equitable transport. Document and share how transport access affects your daily life with local officials. Connect with others who rely on public transport to advocate for inclusive design, and participate in public meetings to ensure diverse voices shape transport planning. When communities organize and speak up, they can transform fare-free transport from a well-intentioned policy into a tool for equity.

## The Path Forward

Free public transport holds immense promise for creating more equitable cities. But "free" doesn't automatically mean "fair." As cities worldwide expand FFPT programs, they must intentionally design systems that truly serve everyone – especially those who've been historically left behind. Also, research itself must become more inclusive. Most studies collect demographic data but fail to analyze it—missing crucial insights about equity impacts on diverse communities.

When we ignore the needs of vulnerable populations in transport planning, we perpetuate the very inequalities these programs aim to solve. By centering equity in FFPT design and research, cities can transform fare-free transport from a nice amenity into a powerful tool for social justice.
