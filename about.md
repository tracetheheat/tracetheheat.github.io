&#9995; Would you like to know what I'm doing, when I'm not reading papers or writing? Or what is helping my to **recharge my battery?**

I'm a devoted runner. I do running a lot. I'm mainly focusing on marathon distances, where I've recently got under 3 hours. I know it's not as outstanding as Eliud Kipchoge or Kenenisa Bekele, but it's enough to refresh my mind. If you like running too, you might take a look on my [running blog](https://www.tracetheheat.com) or just follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/straubd) &#127939;
