&#9995; Would you like to know what I'm doing, when I'm not reading papers or writing? Or what is helping me to **recharge my battery?**

I'm a devoted runner. I do running a lot. I'm mainly focusing on marathon distances, where I've recently got under 3 hours. I know it's not as outstanding as Eliud Kipchoge or Kenenisa Bekele, but it's enough to refresh my mind. If you like running too, you might follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/straubd) &#127939;

**You still here?** 

Feel free to check my [blog](blog.md) &#9749; where I reflect on what's conneced with my research or in case you are a book worm, head out to my <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Books-calling--AxGBjvm2B~M7KZafJ6Px5sDHAQ-eCinMFCsXhQRFxiI3QBAH">book's calling!</a>
