&#9995; Would you like to know what I do, when I'm not reading papers or writing? What is helping my to **recharge my battery?**

I'm a devoted runner. I do running a lot. Now'm I'm mainly focusing on marathon distances, where my main goal is to be confident running sub 3 hours marathon. If you like running too, you might take a look on my [running blog](https://www.tracetheheat.com) or just follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/straubd) &#127939;

Feel free to check my blog &#9749; where I write about stuff related to research, like productivity, tips & tricks, updates of my research/PhD study or just some random thoughts.
